## About Me
I am currently a visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Reed College. Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta from September 2023 to August 2024, working with Professor Bei Jiang at the University of Alberta and Professor Anne-Sophie Charest at Universit√© Laval. From March 2022 to August 2023 I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto, mentored by Professor Zhou Zhou in the Department of Statistical Sciences. I completed my Ph.D. degree from School of Mathematics at Jilin University in December 2020.
